#################################################################
‚úÖ FROM
Specifies the base image from which the Docker image is built.

dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine
Example: Starts from a minimal Node.js 18 image.

‚úÖ LABEL
Adds metadata to the image (key-value pairs).

LABEL maintainer="admin@example.com"
LABEL version="1.0"
Helps with documentation and automation tools.

‚úÖ RUN
Executes a command during the build and commits the result to the image.

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl
Example: Installs dependencies or prepares environment.

‚úÖ ADD
Copies files from host to image, like COPY, but also supports: Remote URLs & Automatic archive extraction (e.g. .tar.gz)

ADD myapp.tar.gz /app/
Unpacks archive into /app.

‚úÖ COPY
Simpler and faster than ADD. Only copies local files into the image.

COPY ./src /app/src
Commonly used for code or config files.

‚úÖ WORKDIR
Sets the working directory inside the image for subsequent commands.

WORKDIR /app
Avoids repeating full paths in RUN, CMD, etc.

‚úÖ ENV
Defines environment variables in the image.

ENV NODE_ENV=production
Useful for configuration and conditional logic.

‚úÖ ARG
Defines build-time variables (unlike ENV, not kept in final image).

ARG VERSION=latest
RUN echo "Building version $VERSION"
Use --build-arg VERSION=1.2 at build time.

‚úÖ USER
Specifies the user to run containers as (security best practice).

USER appuser
Avoids running processes as root.

‚úÖ VOLUME
Declares a mount point for external persistent storage.

VOLUME /data
Data stored here survives container restart.

‚úÖ EXPOSE
Documents the port(s) the container will listen on.

EXPOSE 3000
Used by tools like Docker Compose or when publishing ports.

‚úÖ CMD
Sets the default command to run when the container starts (can be overridden).

CMD ["node", "app.js"]
Only one CMD allowed. Overridden if command is passed at runtime.

‚úÖ ENTRYPOINT
Defines a fixed executable to run. Often used for wrapper scripts.

ENTRYPOINT ["docker-entrypoint.sh"]
Can be combined with CMD for arguments.

üîÅ ENTRYPOINT vs CMD

ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
CMD ["Hello"]
Result: docker run myimage ‚Üí echo Hello
