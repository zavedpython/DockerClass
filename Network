Docker supports multiple network drivers, each providing different types of connectivity between containers, the host, and external networks. Here's a summary of the main Docker network drivers, their types, and use cases:

🔌 1. bridge (Default for standalone containers)
Type: Internal virtual bridge network

Use:  Used for container-to-container communication on the same host.
Default network for containers if not specified otherwise.
Example:
docker run --network bridge my_container


🌐 2. host
Type: Host network stack (Linux only)

Use: Removes network isolation between container and host.
Container shares the host's IP address and ports.
Best for high-performance or low-latency requirements.

Example:
docker run --network host my_container

🔒 3. none
Type: Isolated network

Use: Disables all networking for the container.

Useful for fully isolated workloads or testing.

Example:
docker run --network none my_container


🔧 4. overlay
Type: Cluster-wide virtual network (Swarm mode)

Use: Enables communication between containers on different Docker hosts.
Requires Docker Swarm or Kubernetes.
Commonly used in microservices and distributed apps.

Example:
docker network create --driver overlay my_overlay_net

🛠 5. macvlan
Type: Assigns a MAC address to container (Layer 2 bridge)

Use: Allows containers to appear as physical devices on the network.
Each container gets its own IP on the physical network.
Useful for legacy applications or network appliances.

Example:

docker network create -d macvlan --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 --gateway=192.168.1.1 -o parent=eth0 my_macvlan

👨‍💻 6. ipvlan (Less common, advanced)
Type: Like macvlan but uses different L2/L3 handling

Use: Similar to macvlan, but provides better performance in some scenarios.
More flexible in routing and policy control.

🧩 7. Custom Plugins
Type: Third-party or custom network drivers

Use:  Extend Docker networking with SDNs (like Weave, Calico, Cilium).
Support enterprise-grade policies, monitoring, and scalability.
