In a Dockerfile, both ADD and COPY are used to copy files and directories into a Docker image — but they differ in functionality and use cases.

1. COPY
Purpose: Simple, transparent file copying.
Feature	Description -- Copies	Files/directories from source to image
Source	Must be local
No Extras	Does not extract archives or fetch URLs

Example:
COPY ./app /usr/src/app
📌 Use when you just want to copy files or directories from your build context to the image.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

📦 2. ADD
Purpose: Like COPY but with extra features.
Feature	Description --File copying	✅ Same as COPY
Archive extraction	✅ Automatically unpacks .tar, .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, etc.
Remote URL support	✅ Can fetch files directly from a URL
Example 1 – Copy and extract:
ADD archive.tar.gz /app/

✅ This will automatically extract the archive into /app/.

Example 2 – Download from URL:
ADD https://example.com/file.txt /tmp/

⚠️ Use with caution — downloading via ADD is less transparent than using curl or wget inside a RUN.
